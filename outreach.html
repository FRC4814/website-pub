    <h4 class="heading__desc small-12 columns">Team 4814 was first established during the 2012-2013 school year, when students from London Central Secondary School and Oakridge Secondary School joined forces to create a single FRC Team. With the joint assistance of Eugen Porter, Founder of the WE FIRST Club at Western University, and university student mentors, we successfully built our team’s first robot and started competing.</h4>

    <h2 class="project__title">TVDSB Gifted Program</h2>
    <p class="project__desc">This season we have started working with the Thames Valley District School Board to run gifted itinerant programs. We have visited schools throughout the city and area to simulate a mini-FLL challenge. As well we coached them through the programming of their robots, and taught them about FIRST and its values.</p>

  <div class="row project">
    <h2 class="project__title">Merrymount Family Support and Crisis Centre</h2>
    <p class="project__desc">We visit Merrymount to hold science and technology workshops for children. We use practical methods to teach the children about science and technological concepts. We have used parachutes, balloons, guitars and paper airplanes to teach topics including gravity, static electricity, sounds and waves. Both the children and the organization appreciated our hands-on teaching method and we continue to hold workshops at the centre to ensure continued learning for the children.</p>

  <div class="row project">
    <h2 class="project__title">Girl Guides of Canada</h2>
    <p class="project__desc">FRC Team 4814 paired up with Girl Guides of Canada to teach the participants about science and technology. We taught the girls about basic principles of science, with activities that aim to supplement the curriculum at their grade level. We have used water, soap and pennies to teach them about surface tension. They were also given hands on experience by disassembling and rebuilding computers. The participants enjoyed the opportunity to learn about science and engineering concepts while having fun.</p>

  <div class="row project">
    <h2 class="project__title">Canadian Association for Girls in Science (CAGIS)</h2>
    <p class="project__desc">FRC Team 4814 organized a workshop that introduced coding to members of the Canadian Association for Girls in Science (CAGIS). We taught a lesson on the principles of coding and the importance of learning how to program. Upon completion of the lesson by Team 4814 members, the girls were divided into groups and given a small robot. Each group had to program their robot to complete a maze in the fastest time possible.</p>

  <div class="row project">
    <h2 class="project__title">Western Open House</h2>
    <p class="project__desc">Team 4814 showcased their robot at Western’s March Break Open House to show visitors about FIRST. Our team effectively demonstrated the ideals of FIRST among other University clubs. Faculty and students were astonished by the level of knowledge and professionalism the students of Team 4814 demonstrated. Their depth and breadth of technological knowledge was celebrated and congratulated by visitors to the Western Engineering building.</p>

    <h2 class="project__title">London Science and Technology Fair</h2>
    <p class="project__desc">FRC Team 4814 will be holding a workshop at the annual fair for students in grades 9-12. On April 6th, the team will teach the students about the engineering and design process. Our robot will be present at the workshop and we will be showing the students the design process behind each mechanism. Furthermore, we will be showing the students how to program in autonomous and human controlled mode.</p>

        <h4>About 4814</h4>
          <p>FRC Team 4814, United Robotics Team of London (URL), is comprised of students from Oakridge Secondary School, London Central Secondary School, and Medway High School. The three schools have united as one team and together, our objective as an organization is to inspire youth to become more involved in the fields of science and technology. We strive to create sustainable FRC teams and provide them with the facilities and resources they require to succeed. Our goal is to link London together and our medium is robotics.</p>
